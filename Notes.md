/** 13-11-202
 * Day 1.
 * Created the main skeleton of having a working php framework. Started off building ontop symfony components and yeah, I'm not the only one, Drupal, phpBB3, ezPublish and laravel are built ontop symfony components.
 *
 *  According to the docs, The fundamental principles of our framework should be around the HTTP specification.
 * So in today's lesson, I learnt about Symfony HttpFoundation component which replaces default PHP global variables and functions using an Object Oriented approach.
